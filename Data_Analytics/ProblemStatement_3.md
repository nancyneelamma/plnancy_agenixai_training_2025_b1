# Use Case 3: Predicting Energy Consumption in Buildings

**Business Problem Statement:**
A building management company wants to predict energy consumption to optimize energy usage and reduce costs.

**Dataset Provided:**

Building Characteristics: Size, Age, Insulation Type

Weather Data: Temperature, Humidity

Energy Consumption: Historical Energy Usage

Explanation of the Dataset:

BuildingID: Unique identifier for each building.

BuildingSize: Size of the building in square meters.

BuildingAge: Age of the building in years.

InsulationType: Quality of insulation (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent).

Temperature: Average temperature in degrees Celsius.

Humidity: Average humidity percentage.

EnergyConsumption: Total energy consumed by the building in kWh.

SupplierLeadTime: Time it takes for energy suppliers to deliver new energy sources.

RenewableEnergySource: Type of renewable energy used (Solar, Wind, None).

**How to Use This Dataset:**

Data Analysis Tasks:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate means, medians, and standard deviations for numerical fields.

Regression Analysis: Examine how building characteristics and weather conditions affect energy consumption.

Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning algorithms to predict future energy consumption based on historical data.

Visualization: Use plots (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to visualize trends and correlations between variables.

This dataset provides a starting point for predicting energy consumption in buildings, allowing you to apply various data analysis techniques to optimize energy usage and reduce costs.

Why Data Analysis is Required:
Data analysis is necessary to predict energy consumption based on building characteristics and weather conditions.

How Should the Outcomes be Concluded:
The analysis should conclude with predictions of future energy consumption and recommendations for energy-saving measures.

**Expected Format for Submission:**

Report: Include an executive summary, methodology, findings, and recommendations.

Visualizations: Use time series plots to show energy consumption trends.
