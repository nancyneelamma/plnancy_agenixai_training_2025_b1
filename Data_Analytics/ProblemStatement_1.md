# Use Case 1: Predicting Customer Churn in Telecommunications

**Business Problem Statement:**
A telecommunications company is facing high customer churn rates, which are impacting revenue and customer retention. The company wants to identify factors contributing to churn and develop strategies to reduce it.

**Dataset Provided:**

Customer Demographics: Age, Location, Plan Type

Usage Patterns: Average Call Duration, Data Usage, Number of Calls

Billing Information: Monthly Charges, Payment Method

Churn Status: Yes/No

**Explanation of the Dataset:**

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Age: Customer's age.

Location: Customer's location (Urban, Rural, Suburban).

PlanType: Type of plan subscribed (Basic, Premium).

AverageCallDuration: Average duration of calls made by the customer.

DataUsage: Total data used by the customer.

MonthlyCharges: Monthly charges for the customer's plan.

PaymentMethod: Method used for paying bills (CreditCard, BankTransfer).

ChurnStatus: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).

**How to Use This Dataset:**

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate means, medians, and standard deviations for numerical fields.

Correlation Analysis: Examine relationships between variables (e.g., how AverageCallDuration relates to ChurnStatus).

Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict ChurnStatus based on other variables.

Visualization: Use plots (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots) to visualize trends and correlations.

This dataset provides a starting point for exploring customer churn prediction in telecommunications, allowing you to apply various data analysis techniques to understand and predict customer behavior.

Why Data Analysis is Required:
Data analysis is necessary to understand the factors influencing customer churn. By analyzing demographic and usage data, the company can identify high-risk customers and tailor retention strategies.

How Should the Outcomes be Concluded:
The analysis should conclude with recommendations on how to reduce churn based on identified factors. This could include targeted promotions, improved customer service, or plan adjustments.

**Expected Format for Submission:**

Report: Include an executive summary, methodology, findings, and recommendations.

Visualizations: Use plots and charts to illustrate key findings.
