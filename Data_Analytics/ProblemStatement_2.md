# Use Case 2: Improving Student Performance in Education

**Business Problem Statement:**
An educational institution wants to improve student performance by identifying factors that influence academic success.

**Dataset Provided:**

Student Demographics: Age, Gender, Socioeconomic Status

Academic Performance: Grades, Attendance

Learning Activities: Time Spent on Homework, Participation in Class

**Explanation of the Dataset:**

StudentID: Unique identifier for each student.

Age: Student's age.

Gender: Student's gender.

SocioeconomicStatus: Student's socioeconomic status (Low, Middle, High).

Grades: Student's average grades.

Attendance: Student's attendance percentage.

TimeSpentOnHomework: Average time spent on homework per day.

ClassParticipation: Level of participation in class (Low, Medium, High).

AcademicPerformanceStatus: Whether the student passed or failed (Pass/Fail).

**How to Use This Dataset:**

Data Analysis Tasks:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate means, medians, and standard deviations for numerical fields.

Correlation Analysis: Examine relationships between variables (e.g., how TimeSpentOnHomework relates to Grades).

Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning algorithms to predict AcademicPerformanceStatus based on other variables.

Visualization: Use plots (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots) to visualize trends and correlations between variables.

This dataset provides a starting point for analyzing student performance in education, allowing you to apply various data analysis techniques to identify factors influencing academic success and develop targeted interventions.

Why Data Analysis is Required:
Data analysis is required to understand how different factors impact student performance. By analyzing demographic and academic data, the institution can develop targeted interventions.

How Should the Outcomes be Concluded:
The analysis should conclude with recommendations on how to improve student performance based on identified factors.

**Expected Format for Submission:**

Report: Include an executive summary, methodology, findings, and recommendations.

Visualizations: Use regression plots to show relationships between factors and performance.
